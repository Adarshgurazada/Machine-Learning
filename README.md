# Machine-Learning

### This repository is a collection of Google Colab Notebook files that showcase my progression in machine learning. Starting with basic regression and classification problems, the files gradually increase in complexity, featuring advanced techniques like Discriminant Analysis,KNN and later some Deep Learning techniques. Each notebook includes detailed explanations and code examples to help others learn and apply these techniques to their own projects.
